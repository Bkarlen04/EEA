# EEA
Extended Euclidean Algorithm

A short Python script to calculate the modular inverse of b (mod a) and generate a table of all the steps.

When run it will ask for an input of your a value, then your b value. If an inverse exists it will return a table with all of the steps followed by the inverse. If no inverse exists it will let you know (gcd != 1).
